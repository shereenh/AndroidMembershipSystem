# AndroidMembershipSystem
An online membership (contact/address) app with the server on NJIT's AFS.
The app allows two level of access: administrator or member.
The member is able to view and search for the contact information of other 
members and be able to modify only his or her own information, while an administrator should be able to also add/delete members or modify any member’s information.
A mysql database is used and also hosted on the AFS.

This was a project created for course CS 602 [Advanced Java and World Wide Web Programming] which I took in NJIT's Fall Semester of 2017.
